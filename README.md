This repo is dedicated to a personal project.
In 2020, I used Wix to create a math website mathcollectins.com.

My goal was to share geometry problems and puzzles I had
created for my own students with teachers at my school and around the world.

I did not use a Wix template because I wanted a design that was user-friendly for a math classroom.
I added a bit of interactivity by coding links and buttons, but I had a difficult time including
accordion-style buttons for hints and solutions. A lot of the hints/answers included images and I found
it difficult to style those features. Therefore, I am working on rebuilding this website with html/css/javascript.

I also plan to use local storage to allow users to save favorite problems.
